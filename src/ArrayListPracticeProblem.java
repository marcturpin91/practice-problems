    /*
    Context:
    You are given N lines. In each line there are zero or more integers.
    You need to answer a few queries where you need to tell the number
    located in Yth position of Xth line.
    Take input from System.in

    Input format:
    The first line has an integer N. In each of the next N lines there will
    be an integer D denoting number of integers on that line and then there
    will be D space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an
    integer Q denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of
    two integers X and Y.

    Constraints:
    1 <= N <= 20,000
    0 <= D <= 50,000
    1 <= Q <= 1,000
    1 <= X <= N
    ** Each number will fit in signed integer.
    * Total number of integers in  lines will not cross 100000.

    Output format:
    In each line, output the number located in Yth position of Xth line. If there
    is no such position, just print "ERROR!"

   Sample Input/Output:
   5
   5 41 77 74 22 44
   1 12
